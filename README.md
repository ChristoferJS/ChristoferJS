# A really really really long introduction
Oh hey! Hello, reader! Just like everyone I'm a normal guy current a student, mainly a highschooler.
I'm not really someone who gets high expectations from everyone, but that's okay because I don't get 
pressured when doing something. I have a dream, A dream that I want to achieve someday, although I
don't know on how will I achieve it. But to my future self, I hope I will. My interests are mostly on
Computer Engineering, but mostly Web Development.
