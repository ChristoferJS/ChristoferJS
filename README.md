# A really really really long introduction
Oh! Hello there, reader! Like everyone else, I'm a regular guy who is currently a student, primarily a highschooler. 
I'm not someone who is held to high standards by everyone, but that's okay because I don't feel pressured when I'm doing something. 
I have a dream, a dream that I hope to realize someday, but I'm not sure how I'll do it. But I hope to my future self that I will. 
My main areas of interest are computer engineering and web development.
